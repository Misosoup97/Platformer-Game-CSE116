# Platformer Game – CSE 116 Final Project

This is a side-scrolling platformer game developed in Java for CSE 116: Introduction to Computer Science II at the University at Buffalo.

## 🕹 Project Overview

The course provided a basic engine framework, which included:
- GUI rendering
- Controller structure (input handling)
- Configuration files and base project setup

All gameplay mechanics, logic, and behavior were implemented by me over six milestone assignments.

### 🔧 My Contributions
- Built all gameplay logic using object-oriented design
- Developed physics: jumping, gravity, collisions, platform detection
- Programmed player interactions with objects like potions, spikes, and doors
- Implemented enemy pathfinding using Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Added a sample top-down game variant using the same engine

### 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` – Java source code (core game logic)
- `data/` – Asset files used by the engine (e.g., level layouts)
- `pom.xml` – Maven build configuration
- `.idea/`, `META-INF/`, `.gitignore` – IDE and project config files

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
3. Make sure **Maven** is enabled (IntelliJ will auto-detect `pom.xml`)
4. In the Project view, go to:  
   `src/main/java/app/StartGame.java`
5. Right-click `StartGame.java` → **Run**
